Digital and Analog clocks can be found in the link above

Process
Step1: Train to find clocks
       Train to identity of time
              ->Digital just read numbers
                  ->Erdode to combine digital numbers
                    ->Blur
                    ->Pytesseract read
              ->Train read analog create model
Step2: Crawl through movie for watches
      ->Zipped folder of movies
      ->List of movies that have been analyzed
      ->Create database entry for database object
      ->Integrate spark once test case has been solved
      ->Look for Digital or Analog clock, if found solve for time if time i found:
          ->create clock object
          ->add clock info to database
          ->crop movie and save minute period (30 second before and 30 second after)
Dataobject for a clock-final

clock->time
  ->typeofclock
  ->source
  ->timeBounding
  ->id
  ->name = time_source
  
 Step 3: Create finalCutVideos
 ->Query for a time
 ->Make a random choice of avaliable times
 combine cuts for 5-15 minute intervals
 finalCut->startTime
        ->endTime
        ->videoList
        ->videoTitleList
        ->cutTimes
        ->name = startTime_endTime_index
        '''5 minutes long
 
 
 
 Step 4: Master Loop 
 At some point multithread that loads while videos playing
